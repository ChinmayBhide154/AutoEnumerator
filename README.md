Security testing requires enumeration. Often, this involves port scanning, and then determining the subsequent enumeration steps based on the open ports.

This often requires the penetration tester to exectute multiple commands. However, due to the vast selection of tools available, they take a lot of time to learn.

This project is an automated security scanner which makes scanning and enumeration simple by taking control and executing shell commands on your behalf. It is great
for those with no penetration testing knowledge that just want to scan their app for vulnerabilities.

Currently, this scanner only supports Linux. It is recommended to install a Kali Linux Machine with Virtual Box, Vmware, or another hypervisor. If this is not an option, install the following tools on your machine before using:
 - nmap
 - dirb

This tool is currently in development and is not ready for use yet.

Please be ethical when using this tool and use it only on machines you are authorized to test.
