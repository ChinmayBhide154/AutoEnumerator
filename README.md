Security testing requires enumeration. Often, this involves port scanning, and then determining the subsequent enumeration steps based on the open ports.

This often requires the penetration tester exectute multiple commands. Furthermore, since there are so many enumeration tools, they take time to learn.

This project is an automated security scanner which makes scanning and enumeration simple by taking control and executing shell commands on your behalf. It is excellent
for those with no penetration testing knowledge and just want to scan their app for vulnerabilities.

Currently, this scanner only supports Linux. It is currently in development.
